# Jelly-AssaultCubeCheat

Jelly is a free and open source Assault Cube cheat sample made in C#.

It is using [VAMemory.dll](https://0xthxmxs.github.io/repo/file/VAMemory.dll) for editing memory, but don't worry, it is included in [release](https://github.com/0xThxmxs/Jelly-AssaultCubeCheat/releases).
